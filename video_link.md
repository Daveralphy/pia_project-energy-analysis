## Video Script (3-Minute Transcript)

**Total Estimated Time:** 3 minutes

---

**(0:00 - 0:25) Introduction & The Business Problem**

**[VISUAL: Title slide with project name "US Weather + Energy Analysis Pipeline" and presenter's name.]**

**DAVEAL:** "Hi everyone. Energy companies often face a billion-dollar problem: inaccurate demand forecasting. Overproducing power is wasteful and expensive, while underproducing can risk grid instability. This project tackles this challenge by demonstrating a clear link between weather patterns and energy consumption."

**[VISUAL: The 'Business Value' section of the README.]**

**DAVEAL:** "The goal is to provide a tool that helps utilities optimize power generation, cut operational costs, and improve reliability. Let's dive into how it works."

**(0:25 - 1:20) The Data Pipeline Architecture**

**[VISUAL: The 'Repository Structure' diagram from the README.]**

**DAVEAL:** "At the core of this project is a production-ready, automated data pipeline. It's built on a clean, modular architecture that separates concerns like data fetching, processing, and analysis."

**[VISUAL: The `pipeline.py` script running in a terminal with the `--fetch-daily` command.]**

**DAVEAL:** "Every day, this pipeline automatically runs. It connects to two public APIs: NOAA for weather data and the EIA for energy consumption data across five major US cities. To handle real-world network issues, it has robust error handling and uses automatic retries, ensuring data is always fetched reliably."

**[VISUAL: The `data_processor.py` code, highlighting a data quality check function.]**

**DAVEAL:** "But raw data is messy. So, the pipeline performs crucial data quality checks. It flags missing values, removes impossible outliers—like negative energy usage or extreme temperatures—and verifies that the data is fresh. The clean, processed data is then saved, ready for analysis."

**(1:20 - 2:35) Dashboard & Key Visualizations**

**[VISUAL: A live demo of the Streamlit dashboard, starting with the map.]**

**DAVEAL:** "This is where the data comes to life. The interactive dashboard, built with Streamlit, provides four key insights. First, the Geographic Overview gives us a live snapshot of temperature and energy usage across the country."

**[VISUAL: Presenter clicks on the 'Time Series Analysis' section of the dashboard. Filter for one city like Houston.]**

**DAVEAL:** "Next, the Time Series chart lets us track temperature against energy usage over time. We can clearly see how energy demand spikes during hotter periods."

**[VISUAL: The 'Correlation Analysis' scatter plot.]**

**DAVEAL:** "To quantify this relationship, the Correlation scatter plot shows a strong positive correlation between temperature and energy use. The calculated R-squared value tells us that temperature variations can explain a significant portion of the changes in energy demand."

**[VISUAL: The 'Usage Patterns Heatmap'.]**

**DAVEAL:** "Finally, the heatmap reveals weekly patterns, showing how consumption changes not just with temperature, but also by the day of the week, with clear differences between weekdays and weekends."

**(2:35 - 3:00) Conclusion & AI Collaboration**

**[VISUAL: The `AI_USAGE.md` file.]**

**DAVEAL:** "This entire project was built in collaboration with an AI coding assistant. It was a true force multiplier, handling boilerplate code and documentation drafts, which allowed me to focus on the core logic and analysis. This process is fully documented in the AI Usage file in the repository."

**[VISUAL: Final slide with a link to the GitHub repository and presenter's contact info.]**

**SPEAKER:** "In conclusion, this project successfully demonstrates that by integrating weather data, we can unlock powerful insights for energy forecasting. It provides a reliable, automated, and insightful tool for any utility company looking to become more efficient. Thank you for watching, and feel free to explore the project on GitHub."
