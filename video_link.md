# Video Presentation

This 3-minute video presentation covers:
* An introduction to the business value of energy demand forecasting.
* A live demonstration of the interactive dashboard, showcasing its self-sufficient configuration and data refresh capabilities.
* A technical overview of the automated data pipeline architecture, from data fetching to processing.
* A walkthrough of the key analytical insights and visualizations available in the dashboard after the data is updated.

## Video Script

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Daveal:**
"Hi everyone, I'm Raphael Daveal, and today I'm excited to walk you through my automated Weather and Energy Analysis Pipeline designed to turn complex data into clear, actionable business intelligence."

**(Visual: Screen shows the GitHub repository structure, highlighting the `README.md` and the clean folder layout.)**

**Daveal:**
"While it all starts here in a clean, production-ready repository, the real power is in the interactive dashboard it produces. So, let's jump right in."

**(Visual: Transition to the Streamlit dashboard. It shows data for two cities: Utah and Connecticut.)**

**Daveal:**
"What you're seeing is a completely self-sufficient dashboard. Instead of running scripts from a command line, all the controls are built right into the interface. Right now, we're analyzing Utah and Connecticut, but let's expand our analysis."

**(Visual: Clicks on the 'Edit Configuration' expander. Clicks 'Find City IDs'.)**

**Daveal:**
"I can find reliable weather stations directly from the UI. Let's try adding Arkansas... and Maryland. As you can see, the tool instantly finds active stations for us. Now, what happens if we try a state like Alabama?"

**(Visual: Selects Alabama. A warning message appears: "No reliable stations found with sufficient data.")**

**Daveal:**
"The system automatically flags that there are no reliable stations with enough data for Alabama, so we'll skip it. This built-in data validation is key to ensuring our analysis is always based on solid information. So, let's add New Jersey instead."

**(Visual: Adds the selected cities to the YAML editor in the dashboard. Clicks 'Save Configuration'. Then, goes to the sidebar, selects a date range, and clicks 'Refresh All Data'.)**

**Daveal:**
"Okay, with our new cities configured, I'll just trigger a full data refresh. While the pipeline works its magic in the background, let's quickly look at how it was built."

**(Visual: Transition to a slide or diagram showing the project lifecycle: Plan -> API Keys -> Code.)**

**Daveal:**
"The project began with careful planning and securing API access. The code itself is organized into a clean, modular structure."

**(Visual: Show snippets or file icons for `data_fetcher.py`, `data_processor.py`, `app.py`, and `run.py`.)**

**Daveal:**
"It starts with the **fetcher** scripts, which grab the raw data from the APIs. From there, the **processor** takes over to clean, validate, and transform that data into an analysis-ready format. The dashboard itself is built with Streamlit in `app.py`, but the real magic is `run.py`. This script connects the front-end 'refresh' button to the entire back-end pipeline, making the application truly interactive and self-contained."

**(Visual: Transition back to the live Streamlit dashboard. The KPIs at the top now reflect the new number of cities and the updated date range.)**

**Daveal:**
"And just like that, we're back. The pipeline has finished, and our dashboard is fully updated. You can see our key metrics at the top now reflect the new locations and date range we selected."

**(Visual: Quickly click through each dashboard tab.)**

**Daveal:**
"Now we can explore the updated insights. The **Geographic Overview** immediately maps out the new energy demand hotspots. In the **Time Series** chart, we can compare consumption trends across all our locations, including the ones we just added. The **Correlation Analysis** tab gives us the hard numbers, proving the strong link between temperature and energy use. And the **Heatmap** reveals those crucial daily and weekly usage patterns. Finally, to ensure we can trust these insights, the **Data Quality Report** verifies that all the information we just pulled is clean and reliable."

**(Visual: Return to you on camera for the conclusion.)**

**Daveal:**
"So, in just a few clicks, we expanded our analysis and generated new insights, all without ever leaving the dashboard. That's the power of a well-architected, user-focused data pipeline."

**Daveal:**
"I want to give a huge thank you to the Pioneer Artificial Intelligence Academy, Elder Quass, my team lead Promise, and all my teammates for their incredible support. Thank you for watching! If you found this project interesting, please consider liking, subscribing, and leaving a comment below."
