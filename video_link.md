## Video Script

### 1. Introduction

**(VISUAL: You on camera, friendly and welcoming. Title slide with your name and project title.)**

"Hi guys, welcome to my YouTube channel! My name is Raphael Daveal, and in this video, I’ll be walking you through a data engineering and analytics project I built. We're going to explore how we can use data to solve a very expensive, real-world problem for the energy industry."

### 2. Importance of Data Analysis

**(VISUAL: A clean graphic with a compelling statistic.)**

"First, let's talk about why data analysis is so critical for businesses today. It’s not just about numbers; it’s about making smarter decisions. In fact, a study by McKinsey found that data-driven organizations are 23 times more likely to acquire customers and 6 times as likely to retain them. That’s the power of data, and it’s what this project is all about."

### 3. Project Importance and Business Value

**(VISUAL: The 'Business Value' section of the README, followed by images of a power grid or a city skyline.)**

"So, how does this project help businesses? Imagine you're an energy utility company. If you produce too much power, you waste millions on fuel and resources. If you produce too little, you risk blackouts. My project tackles this by creating a direct link between weather patterns and energy demand.

This tool can support energy companies, grid operators, and even renewable energy firms. By understanding how a heatwave in Phoenix or a cold snap in New York will affect energy use, these businesses can optimize power generation, reduce operational costs, and ensure a stable and reliable energy supply for everyone."

### 4. Repository Structure

**(VISUAL: Screen recording of you scrolling through the project files, highlighting the main directories.)**

"Before we see it in action, let's quickly look at the structure. This project is organized like a professional software application. In the root, we have our configuration files, like `pyproject.toml` which manages all our dependencies.

The core logic lives in the `pia_project_energy_analysis` directory. This is where you'll find separate Python files for fetching data, processing it, and the main pipeline script that ties it all together. The user interface, or the dashboard, is in the `dashboards` directory. And finally, all the data has its own place, separated into `raw`, `processed`, and final `output` folders. This clean structure makes the project easy to maintain and scale."

### 5. How It Works

**(VISUAL: Show the terminal and highlight the `run.py` file.)**

"One of the best parts about this project is its simplicity to run. I’ve created a single entry point. All you have to do is run one command in the terminal: `python run.py`. This single command kicks off the entire process, from fetching the data to launching the interactive dashboard."

### 6. The Input: Fetching Data

**(VISUAL: Show snippets of the `eia_fetcher.py` or `noaa_fetcher.py` code, highlighting the API URLs.)**

"So, what happens when you run that command? First, the pipeline connects to two different government APIs. It pulls daily weather data, like maximum and minimum temperatures, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. At the same time, it fetches daily energy consumption data from the Energy Information Administration, the EIA. The pipeline is built to be robust, with automatic retries, so even if an API is temporarily down, it won't fail."

### 7. The Processing: Creating Value

**(VISUAL: Show a diagram or animation of two separate data streams (weather, energy) being cleaned and then merged into one.)**

"Raw data from different sources is rarely perfect. So, the next step is processing. The pipeline cleans the data by handling any missing values and flagging outliers, like impossible temperatures or negative energy usage. Then, it merges the weather and energy data together based on the date, creating a single, powerful master dataset where every row contains the weather and energy usage for a specific city on a specific day. This is the clean data that powers our analysis."

### 8. The Output: The Dashboard

**(VISUAL: A full screen recording of you interacting with the Streamlit dashboard.)**

"This is where all that work pays off. The data is presented in an interactive Streamlit dashboard, designed to make complex information easy to understand.

**(Point to the map):** On the Geographic Overview, you can immediately see which cities are hot and which are consuming the most energy. If I select just Houston, the map zooms in, but the color and size stay consistent, so you always know which city you're looking at.

**(Click on the Time Series tab):** In the Time Series chart, we can clearly see the relationship over time. When we look at all cities, we can compare their temperature trends side-by-side. You can see the summer peaks in Phoenix are much more extreme than in Seattle. For a utility company, this is crucial for knowing which regions need the most power.

**(Click on the Correlation tab):** The Correlation plot proves this relationship with numbers. We see a strong positive correlation, which confirms that as temperature goes up, so does energy demand. This is the kind of hard data a business needs to build accurate predictive models.

**(Click on the Heatmap tab):** Finally, the Heatmap gives us even deeper insights, showing us that energy usage is different on a hot weekday versus a hot weekend. This allows for even more granular, day-by-day planning.

Together, these visualizations don't just show data; they tell a story that can be used to make smart, cost-saving decisions."

### 9. Conclusion and Acknowledgements

**(VISUAL: A final slide with your contact info, GitHub link, and logos for Pioneer AI Academy.)**

"I'd like to end by giving a huge thank you to the Pioneer Artificial Intelligence Academy, headed by Mr. Dallan Quass, for this incredible learning opportunity. I also want to extend my sincere regards to my amazing team lead, Promise, and all my teammates for their support and collaboration.
