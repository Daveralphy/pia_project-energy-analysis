## Video Script

**(Intro Music Fades)**

**Daveal:**
"Hi, guys! Welcome to my YouTube channel. My name is Raphael Daveal, and in this video, I’ll walk you through how I created a self-sufficient weather and energy analysis dashboard."

"But before we dive in, why is a project like this so important? A recent McKinsey study found that data-driven organizations are **23 times** more likely to acquire customers and **six times** more likely to retain them. That’s the power of data, and it’s what this project is all about."

**(Transition to a graphic or slide about the energy industry)**

**Daveal:**
"Now, imagine you're an energy utility company. You're in a high-stakes balancing act every single day. If you produce too much power, you waste millions on fuel and resources. But if you produce too little, you risk blackouts. This dashboard tackles that exact problem by creating a direct link between weather patterns and energy demand."

"It helps energy companies, grid operators, and even renewable energy firms understand how a heatwave in Phoenix or a cold snap in New York will impact energy use. This way, they can optimize power generation, reduce costs, and ensure a stable, reliable energy supply for everyone."

**(Transition to a screen recording of the dashboard)**

**Daveal:**
"So, let's see it in action. Here is the main dashboard. The first thing you'll notice is that it's completely self-contained. Let's start with the configuration."

**(Show the "Edit Configuration" expander on the main page)**

**Daveal:**
"Right here on the main page, I can manage my entire list of cities. Let's say I want to add a new one. I can use the 'Find City IDs' tool, select a state like Arkansas, and the dashboard automatically finds reliable, active weather stations for me, even warning me if a station might not have good data."

**(Show yourself selecting a station and adding it to the YAML)**

**Daveal:**
"I can select a few, add them to my configuration, and you can see them appear right here in the YAML editor. Once I'm happy with my list of cities, I just click 'Save Configuration'."

**(Show the sidebar)**

**Daveal:**
"Now, to get the data for this new setup, I just go to the sidebar, pick my date range, and hit 'Refresh All Data'. This kicks off the entire backend pipeline right from the dashboard, fetching and processing everything we need."

**(Show the main dashboard with KPIs)**

**Daveal:**
"Once the data is loaded, the dashboard gives us an instant overview with these key metrics: the number of locations we're analyzing, the date range, average temperatures, and the average daily energy consumption."

**(Walk through the dashboard tabs)**

**Daveal:**
"On the **Geographic Overview**, we get a map that instantly shows where energy demand is highest. I can hover over any city, like Houston, to get its specific temperature and energy data."

"The **Time Series** tab lets us dive deeper. We can see exactly how energy demand spikes when the temperature rises. We can even compare multiple cities side-by-side to see how different regions react to weather changes."

"The **Correlation Analysis** tab proves this relationship with hard numbers, showing a clear positive correlation between temperature and energy use. This is the kind of data that's essential for building accurate predictive models."

"The **Usage Patterns** heatmap gives us even more granular insights, showing how consumption habits change not just with temperature, but also by the day of the week."

"And finally, the **Data Quality Report** gives us confidence in our analysis by confirming that the data from our pipeline is clean and reliable."

**(Transition to a high-level diagram or a shot of the code in VS Code)**

**Daveal:**
"So, how does this all work behind the scenes? The project is built like a professional software application."

"I started on GitHub by creating a clean repository structure. The core logic is in the `pia_project_energy_analysis` package. Inside, I have two 'fetcher' files that are responsible for retrieving data from the NOAA and EIA APIs. A 'data processor' then takes that raw JSON data, cleans it, and converts it into a clean CSV format. A 'pipeline' file orchestrates this entire process, and a single `run.py` script triggers this entire workflow, which is what gets called automatically when you hit the refresh button on the dashboard."

**(Return to you on camera for the conclusion)**

**Daveal:**
"So that's it! A fully automated, self-sufficient dashboard that transforms raw data into actionable business intelligence."

"I'd like to end by giving a huge thank you to the Pioneer Artificial Intelligence Academy, headed by Mr. Dallan Quass, for this incredible learning opportunity. I also want to extend my sincere regards to my amazing team lead, Promise, and all my teammates for their support and collaboration."
